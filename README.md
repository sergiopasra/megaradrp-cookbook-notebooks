# MEGARADRP cookbook notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that run the reduction examples in https://guaix-ucm.github.io/megaradrp-cookbook/

The code in the notebooks is pure Python, using the internal functions of Numina to execute the reduction, instead of using the command line.

Caveat emptor: this programming interface is still under development.

The code in this repository is under MIT license.
